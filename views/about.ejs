                How We Started
            </div>
            <div class='review-body' >
              We are, two college buddies who bonded over a shared love of good coffee and the struggle to find
              a decent cup on campus after those long study sessions. Fueled by countless cups of questionable dorm-room brew and a
              yearning for a more inspiring hangout, the idea for Just Cafe was born.
              
              It started as a simple dream - a place where students could grab a quality coffee, fuel their creativity, and escape the
              fluorescent lights of the library. We spent months pouring over business plans (pun intended!), late nights filled with
              brainstorming sessions fueled by questionable instant ramen (don't judge!). Finally, with the unwavering support of our
              families and a whole lot of nervous excitement, Just Cafe opened its doors.

                Our Values
            </div>
            <div class='review-body' >
              Just Cafe is about more than just serving a great cup of coffee. We believe in creating a space that fosters community,
              creativity, and a sense of belonging. We're passionate about:
              
              Quality: We source our beans from ethical and sustainable farms, ensuring a delicious and responsible cup.
              Community: We want Just Cafe to be your home away from home, a place where you can connect with friends, study, or
              simply relax with a good book.
              Creativity: We support local artists and musicians. Our walls are a canvas for their work, and our open mic nights are a
              platform for them to share their talents.
              Sustainability: We're committed to doing our part for the environment. We use eco-friendly practices, from biodegradable
              cups to composting leftover grounds.
              We're still young entrepreneurs, learning the ropes and fueled by the same late-night energy that sparked this dream.
              But one thing is for sure - we're passionate about creating a cafe that makes your day just a little bit brighter. So
              come on in, grab a cup, and let's chat! We'd love to hear your story too.
